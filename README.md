# InventoryManagementSystem
This project follows a structured development approach, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and gradually evolving into a fully optimized and scalable inventory management system.

1️⃣ MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The goal is to deliver a functional system with the minimum necessary features to validate the idea. The focus is on basic functionality and usability.

Essential Features:

- Product registration (name, code, category, quantity, price)
- Stock in/out control
- Product listing and search
- Simple dashboard with stock status
- User authentication (admin and employees)

Technologies & Tools:

- Django (backend)
- Django Admin for quick product and user management
- SQLite (lightweight database for initial development)
- HTML + CSS (or Bootstrap for simple UI design)
- Django REST Framework (if API integration is needed in the future)

Deliverable:

A functional system where users can register products, track stock movements, and view current inventory.

2️⃣ Project Expansion (Enhancements & New Features)

Once the MVP is validated, the focus shifts to performance, security, and usability improvements.

Technical Enhancements:

- 🔹 Migrate from SQLite to a more robust database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- 🔹 Improve UI/UX with React or Vue.js for the frontend🔹 Create an API for external system integration (Django REST Framework)

New Features:

- Supplier and customer management
- Stock movement reports
-  Low stock alerts
-   Change logs (who modified what and when)
-  Data export (CSV, Excel, PDF)
-   Role-based access control (different permission levels
-   Barcode scanner integration

3️⃣ Making the System Production-Ready

At this stage, the focus is on scalability, security, and optimization.

Infrastructure & Deployment:

- Dockerizing the application
- Deploying on cloud servers (AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku)
- Setting up CI/CD for automated deployments
- Data backup and recovery setup

Optimizations:


- Implementing caching for performance improvements (Redis or Memcached)
- Advanced filtering and pagination for handling large data sets
- Security enhancements (protection against SQL Injection, CSRF, etc.)
